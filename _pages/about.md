 📊 I'm a final year undergraduate student at University of Science and Technology of Ha Noi. 

📦 My research experience are in Neutrino Phenomenology and Molecular Cloud

👩🏻‍💻 I'm currently applying for Master's Program in High Computing Physics and Computer Science. 

🏅 I'm also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia. 



Research (for public)
======

------

Generally my research contributes to the Neutrino Mixing Matrix. My research interests span both obsevational (see figure) and roles of energy of in implementing accelerator. 

Most of my work has been working on the three neutrinos framework, focusing parameter degeneracy problem in T2K experiment. The work are under a fine development for scientific publication (preliminary results presented at 48th Vietnam Conference on Theoretical Physics). 

On the other hand, I'm also investigating data analysis of neutrino emulsion to study how to set-up an experiment at lower cost. 


Selected Experience
======
1. Research Assistant in SJTU 
2. Intern in Neutrino Group - IFIRSE/ICISE
