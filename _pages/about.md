üìä I'm currently a full-stack quality engineer in a software developement team. 

üì¶ My research experience are in Neutrino Phenomenology and Machine Learning

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª I'm looking for Master's Program in High Computing Physics and Computer Science



Research
======
![Illustration of my interest](images/HE-Neutrinos.png)

<!-- ------ -->

Generally my research contributes to the Neutrino Mixing Matrix. My research interests span both obsevational (see figure) and roles of energy of in implementing accelerator. 

Most of my work has been working on the three neutrinos framework, focusing parameter degeneracy problem in T2K experiment. The work are under a fine development for scientific publication (preliminary results presented at 48th Vietnam Conference on Theoretical Physics). 

My interest extends to leveraging distributed data storage and processing technologies, including Hadoop, Spark, and ElasticSearch, to enhance the analysis and interpretation of large-scale physics datasets.


* Summer 2022: Lab Intern
  * Space Lab - University of Science and Satellite Technology of Hanoi
  * Duties included: Build an Allsky Camera

Professional Experience
======

Over the past year, I have contributed to software quality assurance by analyzing requirements, creating and executing test cases, and developing automation frameworks with tools like Selenium and Tosca. This experience has equipped me with a strong foundation in systematic problem-solving, a skill I now seek to apply to the critical field of nuclear research. 

* Oct 2024: Software Test Analysis (IRAS/Singapore)
  * Ensure users prep test cases within timeline. 

  * Review test case (including golden flow and integration test scenarios) to ensure there is no gap with the requirements 

  * Prepare test data, test entity, account provisioning using API or SQL commands. 

  * Perform L2 investigative support using SQL to troubleshoot and diagnose issues before escalation to the engineering team 

  * Collaborate with QE-Technical team build test automation and performance scripts using Tricentis Tosca and Postman. 

  * Update the test cases in Azure DevOps and create test plans.
