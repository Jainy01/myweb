üìä I'm currently a full-stack quality engineer in a software developement team. 

üì¶ My research experience are in Neutrino Phenomenology and Machine Learning

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª I'm currently applying for Master's Program in High Computing Physics and Computer Science. 



Research
======
<!-- # ![Illustration of my interest](/images/HE-Neutrinos.png) -->

<!-- ------ -->

Generally my research contributes to the Neutrino Mixing Matrix. My research interests span both obsevational (see figure) and roles of energy of in implementing accelerator. 

Most of my work has been working on the three neutrinos framework, focusing parameter degeneracy problem in T2K experiment. The work are under a fine development for scientific publication (preliminary results presented at 48th Vietnam Conference on Theoretical Physics). 

My interest extends to leveraging distributed data storage and processing technologies, including Hadoop, Spark, and ElasticSearch, to enhance the analysis and interpretation of large-scale physics datasets.
